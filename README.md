# Aurora Standalone

[![CI](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/borealis-engine-lib/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/borealis-engine-lib/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

A collection of Rust crates useful for local ("standalone") deployments of Aurora infrastructure (tooling indexing data about an on-chain Aurora Engine deployment).

## Refiner Application

Refiner allows users to download all NEAR Blocks and get all information relevant to Aurora. NEAR Blocks data can be consumed from two different sources:
- [NEAR data lake](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs): Downloading NEAR Blocks from AWS.
- [NEARCore](https://github.com/near/nearcore): Running an archival nearcore instance.

To run the refiner make sure you have [rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Clone this repository, and run the relevant command within the repository path.

The refiner will save all refined blocks in json files on the specified output path. By default it is `output/refiner/*/block.json`. Blocks will be written sequentially. If the refiner is restarted, it will start from the last block processed.

### NEAR Data Lake

1. Setup AWS locally. Check [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/GsF7I93K-EQ?t=277) to see how to do it.
2. [Optional] Check `default_config.json` parameters.
3. Run the binary:

```
cargo run --release -- -c default_config.json run
```

### NEARCore

1. Check `nearcore_config.json` parameters. Set `input_mode.Nearcore.path` to the path of the `nearcore` data. (Where `config.json` is located).
2. Run the binary:

```
cargo run --release -- -c nearcore_config.json run
```

With this approach a nearcore instance will be launched, and will be syncing with the network. It is ok to download any valid snapshot and start from there. Starting from scratch can take several days(?).

### Docker and DockerHub

Refiner application is published to the Dockerhub and could be found [at nearaurora/srpc2-refiner](https://hub.docker.com/r/nearaurora/srpc2-refiner)

### Data Consumption and Further Usage
The primary consumer for the data generated by the Refiner application is the [aurora-relayer](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/relayer2-public). This component consumes refined data produced by Refiner to populate Relayer database and keep it in sync with NEAR chain.

### Using Aurora Relayer with Standalone RPC
For optimal integration and usage, it is recommended to use [standalone-rpc](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/standalone-rpc). It is a comprehensive script designed to facilitate the smooth rollout of both the Aurora relayer and the refiner. Moreover, it assists in downloading all necessary snapshots required. This approach simplifies the initial setup process, ensuring that users can quickly and efficiently start working with Aurora's blockchain data and services.
